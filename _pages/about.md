I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Nanjing University’s Institute of Acoustics](https://acoustics.nju.edu.cn/), [Scool of Physics](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Sound source localization, Active noise control, and Human pose estimation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lujing](https://acoustics.nju.edu.cn/rydw/szgk/js/lj/index.html) of AA Lab from [Nanjing University’s Institute of Acoustics](https://acoustics.nju.edu.cn/), Nanjing University.
